    # But Yaku?
    # AgariCalculator will return agari=True (shape valid) but Yakus might be empty or restricted.
    # Actually, AgariCalculator enforces 1-han in its `agari` boolean property for non-Yakuman.
    # So if Han=0, calc.agari is False.
    # BUT, if calc.agari is False, `_get_ron_potential` would see False and NOT set furiten?
    # Wait. If Yaku Shibari fails, AgariCalculator.agari is False?
    # Let's check AgariCalculator again.
    # Yes, `agari: (has_yaku || yaku_res.yakuman_count > 0) && yaku_res.han >= 1`.
    # So if Han=0 (no Yaku), agari is False.
    #
    # However, if Dora is present (Han > 0) but No Yaku (Yaku Shibari), then Agari=False?
    # The fix implies we must detect "Shape Valid but Yaku Invalid".
    # AgariCalculator generally returns `agari=False` if Yaku Shibari fails.
    # We might need to inspect `yaku_res` internals or `calc` returns enough info?
    # The `res` struct has `agari` bool. If False, we stop.
    #
    # Wait, the bug report says "Probable Furiten".
    # If the hand has shape but no Yaku, is it Furiten? Yes.
    # Does AgariCalculator support checking "Shape only"?
    # Currently `calc` returns `Agari` struct.
    # We might need to check Tsumo/Ron potential without Yaku Shibari?
    # Or, does `RiichiEnv` manually check `han < 1`?
    # Looking at `_get_ron_potential`:
    # `if calc.agari:` -> Then checks `han < 1`.
    # If `calc.agari` is ALREADY False because of Yaku Shibari, then `_get_ron_potential` skips it entirely.
    # So Yaku Shibari must be enforced inside `AgariCalculator`.
    #
    # If `AgariCalculator` returns False for `agari`, `RiichiEnv` thinks "Not a win".
    # If "Not a win", then NO Furiten logic triggers.
    # BUT "Not a win due to Yaku Shibari" SHOULD trigger Furiten.
    # So AgariCalculator needs to distinguish "Invalid Shape" vs "No Yaku".
    # Or we rely on the fact that if we have 1 Han (Dora) but No Yaku,
    # `calc.agari` might be True/False depending on implementation.
    #
    # In this specific test case: P1 has 4m win.
    # Does P1 have Dora? If No Dora -> Han=0.
    # If Han=0, `calc.agari` should be False.
    #
    # We need to give P1 a Dora to make Han >= 1, but NO Yaku.

    # Yaku Shibari requires `has_yaku`.
    # If `AgariCalculator` sets `agari = (has_yaku ...) && han >= 1`.
    # Then `res.agari` will be False.
    #
    # If `res.agari` is False, `_get_ron_potential` skips line 1201.
    # And my fix logic was inserted inside line 1202 (`if calc.agari:`).
    #
    # If `res.agari` is False, my fix WON'T WORK.
    # I verified in reproduction script that `res.agari` was True?
    # "Agari Result on 4m: Agari=True, Han=1, Yaku=[31]" (from previous step 1109 log)
    #
    # Ah! In step 1109, I had NOT set Dora indicators in the script explicitly?
    # Default wall shuffle -> random dora.
    # Wait, in the logs: Yaku=[31]. 31 is DORA.
    # So Random Dora happened to hit? Or `reproduction_furiten.py` didn't set/clear doras?
    # It called `_initialize_round` with defaults.
    #
    # If `res.agari` is TRUE even with ONLY Dora...
    # Then `AgariCalculator` is NOT enforcing Yaku Shibari in its `agari` flag?
    # Let's check `agari_calculator.rs` or `env.py` logic.
    #
    # If `res.agari` is True, my fix logic at line 1202 triggers.
    # `if not calc.yakuman:` -> `non_dora_yaku = ...` -> `if calc.han < 1 or not non_dora_yaku:`

    # This confirms my fix location is correct IF `res.agari` is True for Dora-only hands.
