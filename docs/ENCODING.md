# Action Encoding Specification

This document describes the mapping between `Action` objects and integer IDs used for model training and inference in RiichiEnv.

## Action Space

The action space consists of **82** distinct actions (IDs 0-81).

| Action ID | Action Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 - 36** | **Discard** | **Discard a tile.** <br> ID corresponds to the tile type index (0-36). <br> `ID = floor(tile_id / 4)`. <br> Red tiles are mapped to their normal counterparts. |
| **37** | **Riichi** | **Declare Riichi.** |
| **38** | **Chi (Low)** | **Chi (Low).** <br> The target tile is the lowest in the sequence (e.g., target 3, consume 4-5). |
| **39** | **Chi (Mid)** | **Chi (Mid).** <br> The target tile is the middle in the sequence (e.g., target 4, consume 3-5). |
| **40** | **Chi (High)** | **Chi (High).** <br> The target tile is the highest in the sequence (e.g., target 5, consume 3-4). |
| **41** | **Pon** | **Pon.** <br> Declaring a Pon on the discarded tile. |
| **42 - 78** | **Kan** | **Kan a specific tile.** <br> Covers Ankan (Closed Kan), Kakan (Added Kan), and Daiminkan (Open Kan). <br> `ID = 42 + tile_idx`. <br> Example: Ankan 0m -> ID 42, Daiminkan 1m -> ID 43. |
| **79** | **Agari** | **Agari (Win).** <br> Covers both Ron and Tsumo. |
| **80** | **Ryukyoku** | **Kyushukyuhai / Ryukyoku.** |
| **81** | **Pass** | **Pass / No Action.** |

## Limitations

### Red 5 Ambiguity in Calls (Chi/Pon)

The current encoding does **not** distinguish between using a Red 5 or a Normal 5 when making a call (Chi or Pon) if both are available in the hand.
-   **Example**: If a player holds `[0m (Red 5), 5m (Normal 5)]` and calls Pon on a discarded `5m`, the action ID `41` (Pon) is used regardless of whether the player consumes the Red 5 or the Normal 5.

### Tsumogiri/Tedashi Ambiguity

The current encoding does **not** distinguish between discarding a tile that was just drawn (Tsumogiri) and discarding a tile that was previously drawn (Tedashi).
-   **Example**: If a player draws a `5m` and immediately discards it, the action ID `5` (Discard 5m) is used. However, the encoding does not differentiate this from a situation where the player had previously discarded a `5m` and then drew another `5m` to discard.
